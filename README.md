# SF Housing Data Analysis

This application will allow users to determine whether a neighborhood is expensive or cheap according to data visualizations through bar charts and line charts. There will also be a interactive map in order to immediately visualize gross rent and sale price per sqr foot of neighborhoods through a quick glance.

## Findings/Analysis 
Housing data was pulled from San Francisco and I first grouped the data by Year and took the average mean, then plotted it on a bar chart to visualize the trend.<br />

This data was then grouped again but without the housing units present and plotted in a lince chart in order to visualize both datasets on the same chart.<br />

An interactive neighborhood map was also created so that users can see which neighborhoods have the highest gross rent or sales price per sqr foot just by looking at dots on a map.
